# Spring Boot Learning

This repository contains my Spring Boot learning journey.
Each folder represents a small backend project built to understand
core concepts step by step.

## What I am learning
- Spring Boot REST APIs
- Controllers, Services, Repositories
- Spring Data JPA & MySQL
- Validation (@Valid, Bean Validation)
- Proper HTTP responses (ResponseEntity)
- Basic error handling

## Projects
- **product-api**: Simple CRUD API using Spring Boot, JPA, and Postman
- **book-api**: CRUD API with validation and clean architecture (in progress)

## Tools
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- MySQL
- Postman

## Notes
This repository is for learning purposes. Projects evolve as I learn
new concepts and improve existing code.
